# Clocks installation
This is an on-going installation that is considered in alpha-version.

The installation deals with the fealings that emerge due to time that passes and time that is running out.

The installation comprises of natural objects (clocks), a sensing device (AI-camera) and a microcontroller (Arduino) to orchestrate interactive visual and auditory experiences.

The installation is built using [ossia score](https://ossia.io/score/about.html), an open-source media sequencer

## The installation
*Spoiler alert!*

The installation comprises of three scenes. The first and second scene play in a loop, while the third scene intervenes upon interaction of a person with the sensing device.

The first scene includes high level representation of time by depicting a video collage of public clocks. The second scene includes a video collage with more personal clocks and objects that depict more explicitly that the time is running out. In the mean time ticks of the natural clocks are constantly heard and digital samples of clock ticks are heard in an increased intensity. 

The third scene has the role of the relief as everything stops and a portion of a poem is heard as soon as person interacts with the sensing device. In the end of the scene or if the person stops interacting the installation starts all over again from the first scene.

## Existing setup
The installation was originally set-up for the Makrovoutes festival in 2022.

An overview of the installation is depicted in the following videos.
